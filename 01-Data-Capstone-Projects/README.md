## 🔍 Project Highlights

### 📞 911 Calls Analysis
- Most common reasons for emergency calls (EMS, Fire, Traffic)
- Peak hours/days for emergency services
- Geographical analysis using **Seaborn heatmaps** and **lmplots**

### 💹 Financial Data Visualization
- Comparison of stock closing prices (BAC, C, GS, JPM, MS, WFC)
- Distribution of returns using histograms and KDE plots
- Rolling averages to compare short-term vs long-term trends
