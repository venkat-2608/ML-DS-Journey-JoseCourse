# 📊 Linear Regression Projects

This folder contains two end-to-end projects demonstrating **Linear Regression**, one of the most fundamental supervised machine learning algorithms. These projects were completed as part of my hands-on learning from Jose Portilla's ML course on Udemy.

## 🏠 Project 1: USA Housing Price Prediction

### 📌 Objective:
Predict **house prices** based on features such as average income, number of rooms, age of the house, etc.

### 📁 Dataset: `USA_Housing.csv`
- `Avg. Area Income`
- `Avg. Area House Age`
- `Avg. Area Number of Rooms`
- `Avg. Area Number of Bedrooms`
- `Area Population`
- `Price` (target)

### 🔧 Tools & Libraries:
- pandas, numpy
- seaborn, matplotlib
- sklearn: `train_test_split`, `LinearRegression`, `metrics`

### 📈 What I Did:
- Performed **EDA** with seaborn pairplots and heatmaps
- Trained a **Linear Regression model**
- Evaluated performance using **MAE, MSE, RMSE**
- Visualized actual vs predicted values

## 🛍️ Project 2: E-commerce Customer Spending Analysis

### 📌 Objective:
Help a company decide whether to focus on **Mobile App experience** or **Website service** to boost yearly spending.

### 📁 Dataset: `Ecommerce Customers.csv`
- `Avg. Session Length`
- `Time on App`
- `Time on Website`
- `Length of Membership`
- `Yearly Amount Spent` (target)

### 🔧 Tools & Libraries:
- pandas, seaborn, matplotlib
- sklearn: `LinearRegression`, `train_test_split`, `metrics`

### 📈 What I Did:
- Compared **Time on App vs Time on Website**
- Analyzed feature correlation with `Yearly Amount Spent`
- Built and evaluated a **Linear Regression model**
- Helped interpret which feature drives spending more

## 🎯 What I Learned

- How to prepare data for Linear Regression
- How to interpret coefficients and feature importance
- How to visualize relationships and residuals
- Real-world business decisions using ML output
