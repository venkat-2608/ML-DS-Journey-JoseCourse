# ðŸ“ˆ Seaborn â€“ Statistical Data Visualization in Python

This folder contains notebooks and exercises related to **Seaborn**, as covered in the [Python for Data Science and Machine Learning Bootcamp by Jose Portilla](https://www.udemy.com/course/python-for-data-science-and-machine-learning-bootcamp/).

## ðŸ“˜ What is Seaborn?

Seaborn is a powerful Python visualization library built on top of **Matplotlib**. It provides a high-level interface for creating **informative and attractive statistical graphics**.

## ðŸ§  Key Concepts Learned

- Creating distribution plots (`distplot`, `histplot`, `kdeplot`)
- Categorical comparisons using box, violin, bar, and swarm plots
- Correlation heatmaps and pivot tables
- Visualizing relationships with scatter + regression
- Grids and subplots for grouped data visualization
- Customizing themes, color palettes, and styles

---

## ðŸš€ Why It Matters

Seaborn makes it easy to:

- Explore patterns in your data
- Identify trends and relationships
- Build EDA dashboards quickly and beautifully

Itâ€™s often the **preferred visualization library** for machine learning and data science projects.

## ðŸ§ª Sample Code

```python
import seaborn as sns
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# Load built-in dataset
tips = sns.load_dataset('tips')

# Create a box plot of total bill by day
sns.boxplot(x='day', y='total_bill', data=tips, palette='coolwarm')

plt.title('Total Bill Distribution by Day')
plt.show()
